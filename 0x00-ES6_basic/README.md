# 0x00. ES6 Basics

## Introduction

Welcome to the **0x00. ES6 Basics** project, an introductory journey into the world of JavaScript with a focus on ECMAScript 6 (ES6) features. This project is designed to help you familiarize yourself with the foundational aspects of JavaScript, emphasizing the modern syntax and functionalities introduced in ES6.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. Understand the fundamental concepts and syntax of JavaScript.
2. Use ES6 features such as `let`, `const`, template literals, arrow functions, and more.
3. Differentiate between var, let, and const in terms of scope and reassignability.
4. Utilize template literals for string interpolation.
5. Implement functions using arrow syntax.
6. Work with default parameters, rest parameters, and spread operators.
7. Explore object and array destructuring.
8. Understand the benefits and usage of the `class` syntax in JavaScript.
9. Leverage the new iteration methods and loops like `for...of`.

## Project Structure

The project consists of multiple tasks, each focusing on different aspects of ES6. You will find exercises, examples, and challenges to practice the concepts.



## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```
   cd 0x00-ES6_Basics
   ```

3. **Run the JavaScript Files**:
   Each JavaScript file contains a script demonstrating the concept it covers. You can run these files using Node.js or in a web browser console.
   ```
   node filename.js
   ```

4. **Explore and Experiment**:
   Modify the code, try new examples, and experiment with the concepts to gain a deeper understanding.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this project, you should have:

1. A basic understanding of programming concepts.
2. A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.).
3. Node.js installed on your machine for running JavaScript files.
