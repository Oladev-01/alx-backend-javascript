# 0x01. ES6 Promises

## Description

This project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of ES6 Promises. Promises are a powerful feature in JavaScript that help manage asynchronous operations. This project will guide you through creating, handling, and chaining promises, as well as understanding how they work under the hood.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the concept of a Promise and how it is used for asynchronous programming.
- Create and manage Promises.
- Chain Promises together to manage complex asynchronous flows.
- Handle errors in Promises.
- Use `Promise.all` and `Promise.race` for concurrent operations.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and asynchronous programming.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x01-ES6-promises.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd 0x01-ES6-promises
   ```

### Usage

To run the examples and tasks, use Node.js:

```sh
npm run dev <filename.js>
```

For example, to run the first task:

```sh
npm run dev 0-promise.js
```

### Testing

Each task file can be tested independently. Ensure to follow the instructions provided in each task to understand the expected behavior and output.
