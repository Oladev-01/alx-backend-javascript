# 0x04. TypeScript

## Description
This project introduces the basics of TypeScript, focusing on creating interfaces, using TypeScript with Webpack, and rendering HTML content using Vanilla JavaScript. The project demonstrates how to use TypeScript to write clean, maintainable, and type-safe code while building a simple web application.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

```
task_0/
├── package.json
├── .eslintrc.js
├── tsconfig.json
├── webpack.config.js
└── src/
    └── main.ts
```

- **package.json**: Contains the project dependencies and scripts.
- **.eslintrc.js**: ESLint configuration for code quality checks.
- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration file.
- **webpack.config.js**: Webpack configuration for bundling the TypeScript code.
- **src/main.ts**: The main TypeScript file where the logic is implemented.

## Features
- **TypeScript Interface**: Defines a `Student` interface to enforce the structure of student objects.
- **Vanilla JavaScript DOM Manipulation**: Renders a table dynamically in the browser, displaying student details.
- **Webpack Integration**: Uses Webpack to bundle and transpile TypeScript code.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name/task_0
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npx webpack
   ```

## Usage

After building the project, open the `dist/index.html` file in your browser. You should see a table displaying the first name and location of the students.

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm installed.
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript and JavaScript.
